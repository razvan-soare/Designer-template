// Welcome to the TypeScript Playground, this is a website
// which gives you a chance to write, share and learn TypeScript.

// You could think of it in three ways:
//
//  - A place to learn TypeScript in a place where nothing can break
//  - A place to experiment with TypeScript syntax, and share the URLs with others
//  - A sandbox to experiment with different compiler features of TypeScript

const anExampleVariable = "Hello World2";
console.log(anExampleVariable);

// To learn more about the language, click above in "Examples" or "What's New".
// Otherwise, get started by removing these comments and the world is your playground.
